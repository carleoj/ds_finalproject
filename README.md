Hi, this is the guide on how to configure/prepare your computer on using the DIGITAL LIBRARY BOOK LENDING SYSTEM.

First, make sure that you have already installed SQLite on your system.
If you haven't yet, refer to these tutorial videos on how to do so:

NOTE: 

=> 'FINALPROJECT.c' - is the main application of the DIGITAL LIBRARY BOOK LENDING SYSTEM.

=> 'librarydb' and 'reservation' are the names of the database files that are used by the program.

=> 'students' is the name of the table on the 'librarydb' database that will be used for storing records.


Steps on how to run the program:

Step 1: Make sure that SQLite works on your computer.
Step 2: Save all the files in one folder along with the database files.
Step 3: Find the main application ('FINALPROJECT.c') and run it.

=> You should be able to run and exit the program without any errors.

To easily view the table or manipulate the SQLite databases, you can use the app called
DB Browser, which is a visual, open source tool that I am using to design and edit SQLite files.
